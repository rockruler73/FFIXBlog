Hey Y’all, hope your FFIX run-throughs are going well! Just finished mine recently, and it was just as amazing as I remembered it. So amazing, in fact, that I was inspired to create a little music video, combining cutscenes from my favorite game with a song from my favorite band, Cloud Cult. The song is called “Pretty Voice”, and it’s all about Zidane and Dagger’s relationship, so I found it fitting 🙂

Let me know what you think! Enjoy!
