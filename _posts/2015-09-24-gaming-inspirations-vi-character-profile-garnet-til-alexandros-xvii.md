Hello, friends, and welcome to the fourth Character Profile of the Gaming Inspirations series! ‚ÄúGaming Inspirations‚Äù is a series of blog posts that puts into words how gaming has inspired me to shed my anxiety and its negative effects on my life. Final Fantasy IX has provided incredible amounts of inspiration (probably because it‚Äôs the greatest game [of all time](http://1wdojq181if3tdg01yomaof86.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kanye_of_all_time_taylor_swift_let_you_finish.jpg)), so I‚Äôm creating a profile for each of the main characters. Each profile will examine their unique qualities and I will detail how, through physical action, I‚Äôm going to help myself lead the life I want to lead by incorporating those qualities.

Today we‚Äôre going to talk about the Princess of Alexandria herself, Garnet til Alexandros XVII.

**CHARACTER SUMMARY**

Here‚Äôs the breakdown: Garnet is a classic ‚Äúdamsel in distress‚Äù character‚Ä¶ for about the first ten minutes. She‚Äôs beautiful, sad, and there are evil thieves trying to kidnap her. But, when the thieves come to whisk her away‚Ä¶ She *asks* to be kidnapped?

Wut?

Throughout her adventures and experiences in *Final Fantasy IX*, she grows from a nerdy member of the royalty who doesn‚Äôt know how to interact with common folk to a compassionate, fearless leader of her kingdom.

**QUALITIES**

**Book-Smart**

In the game, Garnet has a personal tutor who is known as one of the smartest people in the kingdom (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I believe he‚Äôs the only person to have the title of ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù in the entire game).

<figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 438px">[![](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/8/8e/Tot_FFIX_Art.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130323090138)](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/8/8e/Tot_FFIX_Art.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130323090138)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">He also has a top hat. And glasses. What a nerd.</figcaption></figure>Under his tutelage (combined with her love of learning), Garnet becomes‚Ä¶ pretty damn smart. At one point, she mentions how she‚Äôs read all of Lord Avon‚Äôs plays, which seems like a pretty impressive accomplishment for someone to do before they turn 16.

**Street-Stupid**

Sure, she was raised in a castle and is a super-smart beautiful princess-lady, but you learn pretty darn quick that her royal mannerisms and demeanor are‚Ä¶ kind of hard to hide: for example‚Ä¶ well, just watch literally any FFIX Let‚Äôs Play when the party is in Dali for the first time. It‚Äôs an express train to Cringeville.

Being sheltered her entire life, she never learned how to interact with the common folk, much less blend in with them. This is a huge challenge in the first disc, though she gets better with time.

**HOW TO INCORPORATE THESE QUALITIES** **INTO YOUR LIFE**

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned from the smartypants‚Ä¶es(?) in my life, it‚Äôs that their smartypants‚Ä¶iness didn‚Äôt happen overnight, nor did it happen without a good amount of work.

There are two things in the smartypants toolbox, however, that I‚Äôve found make the process a whole lot easier: notes and patience.

Out of everything I‚Äôve learned throughout these posts, one of the biggest has been the importance of note-taking. I‚Äôve been budgeting my money (because damn, student loans are *expensive* and I need to plan for them) using an app, You Need A Budget, for about a year now, so I‚Äôve had some experience with ‚Äúnote taking‚Äù, in a sense, but now I‚Äôm starting to apply it to another part of my life: my diet. Before I started counting calories, I‚Äôd say to myself, ‚Äúoh, well, you had that venti Pumpkin Spice Latte, so now you can‚Äôt eat breakfast. Or lunch. Or dinner. Or anything for the next week‚Äù.

Eventually, I‚Äôd get sick of this whole not-eating thing, eat an entire goddamn pizza to my face, and be right back where I was. I used to think there was something magical about the 209-pound mark that I simply couldn‚Äôt pass; I‚Äôd struggle to get there, and as soon as I did, I‚Äôd slingshot myself back 10 or 15 pounds with a few ‚Äúcheat nights‚Äù. Now, I‚Äôm taking notes: I know what my ‚Äúbudget‚Äù of calories is for the day, and it helps me to better inform my decision-making and pace myself when eating throughout the day. It‚Äôs working: when I started the Gaming Inspirations posts, I weighed 218.8 pounds. This morning, I weighed myself, and I‚Äôm 208.1. Not bad, man. Even rudimentary calorie-counting has taken me from floundering in the darkness of ‚Äúhurr durr I can‚Äôt lose weight‚Äù to slow, steady progress towards my goal weight. Garnet didn‚Äôt just fall into Doctor Tot‚Äôs lap a damn book-learned genius: she had to take notes, study those notes, and adjust future actions based on what she learned.

The second thing that Garnet taught me, patience, is a lot harder. Anyone can take two seconds to write shit down (not to shit-talk note-taking; it‚Äôs an integral part of the self-improvement process), but patience is much more of a practiced skill. A skill that I‚Äôm pretty bad at. But hey, I‚Äôm not gonna get better without practice, so practice I shall.

Garnet, when she had to go incognito as Dagger to avoid recognition, sucked at being a ‚Äúnormal Alexandrian‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt speak the way they did. She didn‚Äôt act the way they did. But when Zidane said ‚Äúhey, Dagger, you probably oughta stop acting so weird and naive and princess-y for a sec‚Äù, she listened. It‚Äôs hard as hell to change behavior, no matter who you are, and she underwent a drastic change to achieve her goal of not getting caught. Sometimes, changes can make you feel‚Ä¶ strange. Uncomfortable. Not like yourself. I feel this way a lot when I‚Äôm trying to implement the changes I write about in these posts. Am I someone who counts calories? Am I someone who stays positive, who speaks up in a group, who is unafraid to try new things?

I‚Äôm not yet. But I‚Äôm trying to be.

This is how Dagger, raised in a castle removed from the society she was to rule, learned her compassion for the common folk. She may have *known* about the life of the commoner before she ran away, but being forced to *live* as one, as awkward a transition as it was, gave her a perspective she never would have had as secluded royalty.

I used to let the fear of failure deter me, but now, I know that I‚Äôm going to fail, and I‚Äôm okay with it. The only reason Garnet succeeded in escaping from Alexandria Castle is because she was patient and strove to understand those different from herself. When she failed, she noted it, she learned from it, and it helped her be better in the future. Change isn‚Äôt instant; it‚Äôs a slow grind to get from where you are to where you want to be, but you‚Äôre not going to get anywhere if you‚Äôre not willing to change, to get a little uncomfortable, to fail once in a while. Princess Garnet helped show me that it‚Äôs worth it to work hard, be patient, and strive for what you really want.

Wow, we‚Äôre halfway through, guys! [Sunday‚Äôs post will be a recap of where we‚Äôve been, and what‚Äôs coming down the pike üôÇ](https://finalfantasyix.com/2015/10/01/gaming-inspirations-recap-where-weve-been-where-were-going/)
