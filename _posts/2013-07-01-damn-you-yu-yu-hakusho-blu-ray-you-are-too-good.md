Hey Yâ€™all,

I made some progress on the editing this weekend. Admittedly, it wasnâ€™t as much progress as I had hoped, but I should still be good for a release of the first episode of the LP this weekend! ðŸ˜€

It would be much easier, however, if my roommate and I werenâ€™t smack-dab in the middle of my favorite anime of all time (*Yu Yu Hakusho* \[Iâ€™ll have to write something up comparing it to *FFIX*, since I believe theyâ€™re extremely similar philosophically and thematically\]). I picked up the Blu Rays for all the seasons, and damn, does it look good. [Hereâ€™s a link to a side-by-side comparison of the SD and 1080p remastered versions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfbCzQ5fq9A) â€“ they went frame-by-frame and made the entire thing look amazing. Pump that video up to 1080p and enjoy. Lemme tell ya, watching Yusuke absorb the Spirit Wave Orb in 1080p, blasting the volumeâ€¦ Itâ€™s intense, man. Soooooo good. Highly recommended. To anyone. Ever.

Anyway, weâ€™re in the final round of the Dark Tournament now, so after that Iâ€™ll probably stop obsessing as much as I have been recently and put my nose to the grindstone a bit more :p

If youâ€™re interested in purchasing *YYH* (which you should be, if you have a soul \[and a blu-ray player\]), itâ€™s only $21 per season or so. Itâ€™s a great investment.
