My Letâ€™s Play may not be working at the moment (which I will work on in about an hour, when I get outta work), but I have found something really, really cool on the internet today.

Hironobu Sakaguchi, in case you didnâ€™t know, was the main writer for *Final Fantasy IX* (and a bunch of other *FF*â€˜s besides). He has said before that *IX* is his favorite of the series, which, admittedly, makes me pretty happy, since, well, it *is* the best ðŸ˜‰

Anyway, I was snooping around, and I found [this article](http://www.mistwalkercorp.com/en/column/pg187.html) on his Mistwalker blog. This post was apparently a .txt file that was on a backup hard drive of his, and it details the very beginning of *FFIX*. I had never seen it before, and I thought Iâ€™d share it, cuz it seemed super cool!
