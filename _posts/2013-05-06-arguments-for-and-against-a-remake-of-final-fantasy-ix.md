**For: The Artwork Can Only Get Better**

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">One of my friends posted something very interesting to my Facebook the other day: a link to some “lost” </span>*Final Fantasy IX*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> artwork. I’ve owned </span>*The Art of Final Fantasy IX*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> for years, so when I saw the link, my first thought was “yeah, okay, but I’ve definitely seen this before”.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Boy, was I wrong.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">(Before I go any further, I’ll give y’all the link: </span><http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=551612><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">).</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">My jaw dropped. There were about 100 pictures here that I had never seen before, all in a resolution about three times what the original PlayStation disc could handle. As Mama Robotnik, the author of the above forum post, said, “The ‘lost art’ referenced in the thread title isn’t meant to describe this content as having been lost and found – it refers to the art details that were lost when the graphics were downconverted to a limited 32-bit console”.</span>

<figure aria-describedby="caption-attachment-65" class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_65" style="width: 529px">[![Ruby's Mini Theater Never Looked So Good.](http://ffixblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/alexandria-mini-theater.jpg)](http://ffixblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/alexandria-mini-theater.jpg)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-65">Ruby’s Mini Theater Never Looked So Good.</figcaption></figure><span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Needless to say, I was amazed. After purely enjoying the artwork for a while, a thought popped into my head: if they’ve got these really high-resolution backgrounds already, that </span>*must*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> make it easier to craft a remake, should they choose to do so. They’ve already got a bunch of great work already set up for them, for cryin’ out loud! So why won’t they do it?</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">At first, I was against a remake of </span>*FFIX*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">; I thought that the original was perfect, and that they needn’t do anything else. However, when I watched </span>*Yu Yu Hakusho*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">, my favorite anime, </span>[in 1080p Blu Ray](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfbCzQ5fq9A)<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">, I realized that making things look prettier given newer technology could, if not increase my enjoyment, give me another, more detailed look at exactly what the artists were going for when they created the work.</span>

**Against: *Final Fantasy VII* Fans are Mad Enough**

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Seriously, though. They thought they were getting a PS3 makeover for the franchise’s most popular game </span>*years*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> ago. Square Enix has said that they won’t remake it until they make a new title that surpasses the original, both in sales and in quality (see </span>[this GameSpot article](http://www.gamespot.com/news/no-final-fantasy-vii-remake-until-square-enix-tops-original-6384331)<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">, if you haven’t heard this already).</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Look, Square Enix: it’s just not going to happen.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">It’s a vicious cycle: basically, they’re trying to make a game that is so good that it will make people forget about </span>*VII*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> as being considered “the best”. However, people can’t get the idea of a </span>*VII*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> remake out of their heads. They won’t give Square Enix a chance until it’s done. Look, Square Enix, it’s not all your fault that you won’t make a game that’s better; it’s equally the fault of the gaming community for being really bad at looking at new games in the same nostalgic light of the old classics that they hold so dear. That’s just a part of human nature, though, I think – there’s a reason they’re called “the good old days”. Part of business is learning when to stretch for something new, and when to shut up and give your diehard fans the content they have waited so patiently for. I don’t think Square Enix has learned that yet.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">So yeah, they won’t remake </span>*VII…*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> But they’re remaking </span>*FFX* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">in HD, which was already made with quite-sexy PS2 graphics. Way sexier than “the-first-PS1-*FF*” graphics, for sure. They’ve remade </span>*I* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">and </span>*II* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">for the GBA, and </span>*III* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">and </span>*IV*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> for the DS. I just get the feeling that if they remake any more </span>*Final Fantasy*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> titles before </span>*FFVII*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">, there will be pitchforks sharpened and torches lit. Even I, who thinks that </span>*FFIX*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> is one of the greatest pieces of media ever created, far more philosophically and artistically intriguing than </span>*VII*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">, am waiting impatiently for Square Enix to remove their craniums from their posteriors.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">I think I can sum up most everyone’s opinion on this with three simple words:</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">God dammit, Squeenix. (Cute nickname, right?)</span>

**For: It Will Remind Square Enix About What Squaresoft was Doing Right**

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">This may be a bit of a radical opinion, but I honestly think that if the next </span>*FF*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> were released without the use of voice actors, the overall opinion on the quality of the game would rise. I’m not going to spend much time on defending myself here; just check out Ian’s blog post, “</span>[Hearing Voices](https://www.finalfantasyix.com/2013/05/02/hearing-voices-published-2192013/)<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">”, and you’ll basically have an idea of what my argument is behind this.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">I think that, recently, </span>*Final Fantasy*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> has gone the way of most game companies, focusing more and more on </span>*realism*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> – </span>*real-looking* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">people, dynamically-rendered, interactive worlds, and the like.</span>

*Realism*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">. When the title of the game is </span>*Final **Fantasy***<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">I feel like they’ll get the idea when they’re in the middle of an HD makeover for, say, Hippaul.</span>

*Final Fantasy IX*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">, like most of the great </span>*Final Fantasy* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">titles before it, has an expansive, colorful world. There were many different, non-human races that looked distinctly fantastical (again, Hippaul). Even the main characters aren’t supposed to look </span>*real*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">; they’re chibi to the max, and I love it. There was always something new to discover, to explore. By the third disc, you’re basically let loose, able to take care of most side quests, etc. in the game. No more rails. The game designers had enough faith in your intelligence to let you go do your own thing, make your own mistakes and get out of them. This is getting ever rarer in the big-name game companies, and it’s something that they could take a lesson in if they look at their old games.</span>

**Against: Square Enix Has to Let People Know that They Can Craft Good Games**

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Personally, I enjoyed </span>*FFX:2*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> (I will understand if you stop reading now). </span>*FFXII* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">was a solid game, to the point of MetaCritic giving it a </span>[92 out of 100](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/final-fantasy-xii)<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">, which is equal to </span>[*FFVII*’s score](http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/final-fantasy-vii)<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">. However, it was nowhere near as popular as </span>*VII* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">was (to the chagrin of many a </span>*XII* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">fan). There was one thing that </span>*VII* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">had more of than most other </span>*FF* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">titles: </span>[a giant North American marketing campaign](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII#Release)<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">. I don’t ever remember seeing any pre-release brouhaha for </span>*XII*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">. While it proves that Squeenix </span>*can*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> make a solid game, they need to promote it more. A remake of </span>*FFIX* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">now could create the image that all they’re good for is remaking the games of their predecessors, basically admitting defeat and saying they can’t surpass the classics.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Poor Squeenix.</span>

**My Opinion: If You’re Gonna Use It, Keep It; If Not, Give It to Someone Who Will**

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure that characters from </span>*FFIX*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> have been used only a handful of times since its release (Zidane/Kuja in </span>*Dissidia*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">; Zidane in </span>*Theatrhythm*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">; Vivi in </span>*KH2*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> are the ones I can think of immediately). Because </span>*VII*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> is still making money off of its spin-offs and movies and such, keep those rights; however, if you’re not gonna use the characters, art, etc. from other franchises… why not give these to the public? </span>*FFIX*<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;"> may not be popular enough to make much money off of anymore, but from my experience, it has a cult-like following of rabidly dedicated players who would </span>*love* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">to sink their teeth into community-made remakes/sequels/etc. While unrealistic, I think that would be a great thing for Squeenix to do. Even if it’s just the engine. Look what happened when Valve released Source SDK: it spawned some of the best games of the past decade.</span>

<span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">Like the people waiting for a </span>*VII* <span style="font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;">remake, however, I won’t hold my breath.</span>
