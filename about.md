My name’s Casey, and I’m the owner of this little blog, here. I love Final Fantasy IX; not only do I think it’s an incredible video game, but I think that it has a lot to offer on many different levels, including philosophical, spiritual, and artistic.

This is a very freeform blog, and I will accept blog posts from most anyone. If you’re interested in submitting a post (or helping in any other way), hit me up at ffixblog@gmail.com.
