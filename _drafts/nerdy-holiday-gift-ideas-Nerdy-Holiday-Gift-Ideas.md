Hey Y’all,

In no particular order, here’s what I’m drooling over this holiday season – if you’re a fan of FinalFantasyIX.com, buy your stuff through these links and support the site’s operating costs for years to come!

[The Collected Works of Hayao Miyazaki](http://geni.us/3vx2) – $215

Man, it’s a chunk of change, but I *waaaaaaaaaaant* it. Released just in time for the holidays, this Blu Ray collection is sure to make tons of Miyazaki nerds like myself *waaaaaaaaaaant,* too.

[Retro Duo Portable Console V2.0](http://geni.us/Vt5) – $90

I mean… who *wouldn’t* want to play NES/SNES games on-the-go? Honestly, I’m wondering who *wouldn’t* want to drop less than $100 on such an incredible invention.

[Final Fantasy IX](http://geni.us/KOe) – $15

Give the gift of the greatest game of all time. The amount of copies of this damn thing I’ve bought must be in the double digits now… and I wouldn’t take any of it back. So worth it.

[Playstation 4/Star Wars Battlefront Bundle](http://geni.us/2EdY) – $350  
([Link to just the game](http://geni.us/7xh) – $60)

A console I really want bundled with one of the most-anticipated games of the year? Nothing wrong with that!

That pretty much rounds out my gaming-nerd holiday wish list! What are you looking forward to? Sound off in the comments!
