Trust me, it’s really exciting.

Rates start at $6/year. I can give you a breakdown of these costs when you email me at Zidane@FinalFantasyIX.com with the address that you’d like (I promise I’m not tryin’ to rip anyone off). Literally everything except for “Zidane” is still open, so come and get it!
