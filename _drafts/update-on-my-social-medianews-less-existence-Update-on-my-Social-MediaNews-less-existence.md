Hey y’all!

I’ll be honest – I’ve reflexively hit the Facebook app a few times on my phone, and I went on once to message a buddy about something pretty important, but other than that the experiment is a wild success! No podcasts, no news, no social media, and I’ve gotten more done in the past few days than I thought possible. I’m learning to cut back on multitasking, and be in the moment with whatever activity I’m doing. It feels wonderful, and I’ve found it much, much easier to enter the elusive “flow state”.

I HIGHLY recommend going on a social media/news fast to anyone, at least at this point. I’ll let you know if I’m sick of it by Sunday.
