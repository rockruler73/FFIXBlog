Hey guys!

Sorry I haven’t been around recently – I’ve come up with a few nice blog posts, but I’ve had a few other projects kinda take over for a while. That said, I did make this video that I wanted to share with you: a musical montage featuring 6 different versions of Final Fantasy’s “Prelude”!

Enjoy! &lt;3
