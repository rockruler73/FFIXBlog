If you’re into Abridged series, have I got one for you!

My brother, the globally-renowned YouTuber LegendByDesign, has put together the first episode of a Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood abridged series. I’m in it. It’s great. Check it out! (And check out the rest of his stuff – Legend puts in a shitload of work on his YouTube channel, 100+ videos, and he’s got something for everyone!)
